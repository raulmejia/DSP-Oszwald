## Purpose
This repository stores code to analyze DSP data 

## Overall design
The master script is named "DSP_Orchester.R" this program was intented to coordinate all the rest (still under development). You can see a graphical description in the svg file.

The particular script to perform differential expression on data from hybridization is named "Differential_expression_hybridized-n-scanned-Data-trough-limma.R" [here](https://github.com/raulmejia/DSP-Oszwald/blob/master/README_DEG.md) a description how to use it. [here](https://github.com/raulmejia/DSP-Oszwald/blob/master/DemoData) Demo Data to try it out.

The are other useful scripts like "Update KEGG"
